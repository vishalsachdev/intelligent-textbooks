Title: From Moldy Books to a PhD: The Great Information Reincarnation

I have a good friend named Hadi who grew up in Indonesian in a very poor village.  He is now a PhD and head of the data science program at a Fortune-50 company that employs over 40,000 software developers.
Hadi is very exited about the prospect of children in the more report rural parts of Indonesian all having access to adaptive intelligent textbooks that quickly generate new content tuned to the need.  

This is the story of a "reincarnation"—not into a fantasy world, but from the humidity of a 1990s Indonesian classroom to the heights of American academia.

Here is your story, framed with high-octane hooks and a "Zero to Hero" narrative arc.

The Hook: The Smell of 1990

Imagine a room so humid your skin feels like it’s melting. You’re ten years old. You aren't studying; you are massaging your teacher’s shoulders because that is what "respect" looks like. But your eyes are locked on the desk.
Between you and three other kids lies a single, decaying object: The Textbook. It didn’t just look old. It looked alive. It was covered in black and green mold—a biological hazard posing as a math book.

The "Moldy Mosaic" Strategy

In 1990s Indonesia, we didn’t own knowledge. We "rented" it from the state.

 * The Struggle: The pages were so rotted by fungi that Page 42 was unreadable in my book.
 * The Hack: My deskmate’s book was missing Page 43.
 * The Win: We had to cross-reference our "moldy mosaics" just to finish a homework set.

If you couldn’t read the text, you didn't go to Google. You went on a scavenger hunt. You got lucky if the mold didn't eat the same paragraph in two different books. This was survivalist learning.
Jungle Discovery Mode: The PhD Leap
Fast forward twenty years. I am standing on a university campus in the United States. I am finishing a PhD.
To the world, I’m a scholar. To myself, I’m still that kid from Surabaya/Medan hacking through a jungle with a butter knife.

 * The Barrier: My family never finished middle school.
 * The Reality: I didn't have a map for college. No "legacy" advice. No "insider" tips.
 * The Mode: I was in Full Jungle Discovery Mode. Every syllabus, every grant application, every networking event was a vine I had to cut through just to see the sun.

The Great Equalizer: The End of Luck
Here is the "Beginning After the End" moment.
Back then, your destiny was tied to the quality of the moldy book the teacher handed you. If you were in a poor village, you were stuck. That era is dead.

With a low-cost old laptop and an internet connections, the walls have crumbled.

 * The MIT Desk: A kid in a remote Indonesian village now sits in the same "virtual" front row as a billionaire’s son.
 * You don't need a local hero. You can study the mental models of the world's greatest engineers or the coding logic of the world’s best engineers in real-time.
 * The AI Guide: AI is the "Master" who never gets tired of your questions. It doesn't ask you to massage its shoulders. It just gives you the light.

The Final Boss: Your Own Mind

We are moving toward a Starlink Reality. When high-speed internet hits every corner of the archipelago, the "infrastructure" excuse vanishes.
The bottleneck is no longer the book. The bottleneck is the prompt.

If you have the internet, you have the keys to the kingdom. The only thing standing between a kid in a Surabaya alleyway and a PhD in the Ivy League is the courage to ask the right questions.

The "Jungle" has been paved. Now, the only question is: How fast can you run?
Next Step for You

Background for Education in remote Indonesian

The memory of textbooks being "given" by teachers but requiring return is 100% accurate. This was the Buku Paket (Package Book) system, a central pillar of the New Order's educational infrastructure in the 1990s.

​The "Buku Paket" Experience

​The Loan Ritual: At the start of the school year, teachers or librarians distributed a set of government-issued books. These were not gifts; they were state property on loan.
​The Inventory Check: Every book had a unique school stamp or number. At the end of the year, you were required to return them. If you lost one, you had to replace it—this is a major reason why the Titi Gantung used-book market was so essential.
​The Penalty: If a book was damaged or missing, parents often had to pay a fine or find a replacement copy to "hand back" to the school library.

​Why They Were Handed Out

​Centralized Control: The Ministry of Education controlled 100% of the content to ensure a uniform national narrative, particularly in History and PMP (Civics).

​Subsidized Scarcity: The state aimed to remove the cost barrier for families. However, they rarely printed enough for a 1:1 ratio, which caused the "propel share" (sharing) dynamic where two students sat side-by-side with one battered book.

​The Ritual of "Sampul Buku" (Book Covering)
​To ensure books survived the year for the next student, schools enforced a strict covering ritual:

​Brown Paper (Sampul Cokelat): Every student had to wrap their borrowed books in standard brown paper.
​The Plastic Layer: You then added a layer of clear plastic to protect against rain and Medan’s humidity.
​The Irony: Ironically, the moisture trapped under that plastic cover often accelerated the growth of the mold you remember, as the paper couldn't "breathe."

Hadi: I grew up probably in surabaya elementary school in Indonesia. And I remember as a kid, we will be asked to message our teacher shoulder because they are our elder. And while I don't remember the full detail or buku packet. I remember that I have to share book. And ewww, this moldy book.

And... If I can't read the text because it's moldy I have to find other book that we usually get lucky because the mold is not in the same page.

 We had to share text book between desk mate (or sometime even 4 people share one book). And we must return book after class. Nobody own book back then.

And fast forward, through a series of coincidences, eventually  I get PhD in United States. But it's hard because my family members never graduate from middle school. Navigating college in a different country and first time college really is full in jungle discovery mode right? 

But with Ai now, it feels like that kid in Indonesia can have the opportunity to learn from the best teacher in MIT through an intelligent textbook. And this truly will give hope to people in impoverished countries, assuming they have internet. (which has gotten better). And who knows, maybe Starlink will enter Indonesia and change the internet access paradigm. But these intelligent books are the ray of the hope for the future. If you have access to internet and a device that has internet. If somebody guide you buy asking the right questions. Only your own mind is your limiting factor.
Warm Regards,
Hadi
