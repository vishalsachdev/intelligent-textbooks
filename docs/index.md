# Building Intelligent Textbooks With AI

![Cover Image](./img/cover.png){ width="750" }

*Intelligent textbooks guide students through concepts
on their quest for knowledge.*

Welcome to the website for a step-by-step guide to building [intelligent textbooks](./glossary.md#intelligent-textbook) using open standards.

!!! Announcement
    We now have dozens of Claude Code Skills that automate over
    90% of the tasks required to build level-2 textbooks from a course
    description.  See our [Claud Skills](https://dmccreary.github.io/claude-skills/)
    intelligent textbook for more information.  It rocks!!

Most of the examples on this website use the [mkdocs](http://mkdocs.com) build system 
paired with generative AI to create and maintain intelligent textbooks.  We also
leverage the [material theme](./glossary.md#material) to create customized look-and-feel
systems for textbooks.

We feel that many courses today can benefit for high-quality online textbooks that have some of the following features:

1. Powerful and easy to use [Search](./glossary.md#search)
2. Site [Navigation](./glossary.md/#navigation)
3. [MicroSims](./glossary.md#microsim) - adding interactive simulations to any page using p5.js or iframes
4. [Glossary of Terms](./glossary.md#glossary-of-terms)
5. Table of Contents - generate a [table of contents](./book-table-of-contents.md) for the entire book
6. [Link Checker](./glossary.md#link-checker) - check for broken links on the website
7. [Social Media Previews](./glossary.md#social-media-previews) and local override
8. Rendering [Formulas](./glossary.md#formulas) - allow pages to include complex equations and mathematical formulas
9. [Code Highlighting](./glossary.md#code-highlighting) - make code easy to view with color syntax highlighting
10. [License Management](./glossary.md#license) with a link to the license in the footer of each page
11. [Site Analytics with Google Analytics](./glossary.md#website-analytics)
12. [Edit from GitHub](./glossary.md#edit-from-github)
13. [Automatic Build](./glossary.md#automatic-build)
14. [Quiz Management](./glossary.md#quiz-management)
15. High quality website logo and [favicon](./glossary.md#favicon) generate for multiple environments [Logo and Favicon](./tutorial/logo-and-favicon.md)
16. An easy-to-visualize [Concept Graph](./glossary.md#concept-graph) that shows all the concepts in the class and their dependencies.
