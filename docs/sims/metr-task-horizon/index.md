## Overview

The METR methodology measures AI capabilities by the **task horizon**—the duration of a human task that an AI system can complete with 50% probability of success. This metric provides a practical, real-world measure of AI capability growth.

## Key Findings

### The 7-Month Doubling Time

Analysis of frontier model performance reveals a consistent exponential growth pattern:

- **GPT-2 (Feb 2019)**: 2.4 minutes
- **GPT-4 (Mar 2023)**: 322 minutes (5.4 hours)
- **GPT-5 (Aug 2025)**: 8,239 minutes (137 hours)

This represents a **3,400× improvement** over 78 months, or approximately **11 doublings**.

### Projection to 2030

If the 7-month doubling continues:

| Date | Task Horizon |
|------|--------------|
| Aug 2025 | 5.7 days |
| Oct 2026 | 23 days |
| Dec 2027 | 92 days |
| Jan 2030 | 915 days (~2.5 years) |

- **Hover**: See model names and exact values

## Implications for Education

This growth rate has profound implications for educational content creation:

- Current AI can handle tasks lasting days
- By 2027, multi-week autonomous projects become feasible
- Content creation costs approach zero as AI handles longer creative tasks
