## How to Use This Matrix

### Axes

- **Y-Axis (Technical Capability)**: AI expertise, development resources, LLM access
- **X-Axis (Data Readiness)**: Privacy compliance, student data infrastructure, LRS capability

### Key Insights

1. **Start with Level 2**: Most organizations should begin here—low risk, high value
2. **Leapfrog to L4**: High-capability orgs can skip L3's data requirements
3. **L3 is strategic**: Building data infrastructure now positions you for the future

## Strategic Considerations

| Starting Point | Recommended Path |
|----------------|------------------|
| New to ed-tech | L1 → L2 → L3 |
| Strong tech, weak privacy | L2 → L4 (skip L3) |
| Strong privacy compliance | L2 → L3 → L4 |
| Research institution | L3 → L4 → L5 pilots |
