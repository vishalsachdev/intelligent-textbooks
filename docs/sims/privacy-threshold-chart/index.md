## The Privacy Threshold

Below Level 3, intelligent textbooks can function with minimal or no student-specific data:

- **Level 1 (Static)**: No data collection
- **Level 2 (Interactive)**: Anonymous usage analytics only.  
Example: Web analytics logging such as how many users visited what pages
and when they accessed the pages.  Minimal tracking of return visitors
using web browser cookies.  Users can indicate what concepts they
have mastered and a learning graph running in the browser can
recommend the next concepts and content to learn.

At Level 3 and above, personalization requires detailed individual tracking:

- **Level 3 (Adaptive)**: Individual learning histories, performance data
Quiz and assessment results, prediction of next concepts, customization
of learning path based on prior mastery of skills such as understanding
an explanation using mathematical equations.
- **Level 4 (Chatbot)**: Conversation logs, question patterns,
intent matching.
- **Level 5 (Autonomous)**: Comprehensive cognitive profiles
including student fatigue, needed repetition levels for fact memorization.

## Regulatory Implications

This threshold triggers compliance requirements:

- **FERPA** (US): Education records protection
- **COPPA** (US): Children's privacy for K-12
- **GDPR** (EU): Consent, data minimization, right to erasure
