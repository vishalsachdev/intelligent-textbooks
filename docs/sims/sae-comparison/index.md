# SAE J3016 vs Intelligent Textbook Levels

This visualization shows the parallel between autonomous vehicle classification (SAE J3016) and our proposed intelligent textbook framework.

## Why This Analogy Works

Both frameworks share critical characteristics:

1. **Capability-based definition**: Levels defined by what the system can do
2. **Clear responsibility allocation**: Who controls the experience
3. **Graduated expectations**: Full autonomy remains aspirational
4. **Regulatory inflection point**: Level 3 triggers new requirements

## The Level 3 Parallel

In both domains, Level 3 represents a critical threshold:

| Domain | Level 3 Change | New Requirement |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Vehicles** | System takes primary control | Liability frameworks |
| **Textbooks** | System tracks individual learning | Privacy frameworks |

## Lessons for Education

The SAE J3016 standard transformed automotive discourse by:

- Enabling clear communication
- Supporting appropriate regulation
- Setting realistic expectations

Intelligent textbooks deserve the same clarity.
