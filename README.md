## 📖 About

This project is a series of resources to help teachers worldwide create the foundation for **free and open intelligent textbooks**. Our focus is on helping instructors create Level 2 textbooks that use a [learning graph](https://dmccreary.github.io/intelligent-textbooks/glossary/#learning-graph) as their core data structure to ground content generation and guide learning agents.

### Why Intelligent Textbooks?

Traditional textbooks are static. Intelligent textbooks adapt to learners, provide interactive experiences, and leverage AI to create personalized educational content. This project demonstrates how to build textbooks that:

- **Adapt to individual learning paths** using concept dependency graphs
- **Provide interactive simulations** (MicroSims) for hands-on learning  
- **Generate content dynamically** using AI prompts and workflows
- **Scale globally** using free, open-source tools

## 🚀 Create Your Own Textbooks

### Quick Start: Generate a New Textbook

This repository includes scripts to rapidly create independent textbook repositories:

```bash
./scripts/create-textbook.sh biology-101 "Biology 101"
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Complete MkDocs site ready to deploy
- ✅ Latest skills from [dmccreary/claude-skills](https://github.com/dmccreary/claude-skills)
- ✅ Framework plugins and tools
- ✅ Starter content structure
- ✅ GitHub Actions for auto-deployment
- ✅ Update scripts for staying current

**Perfect for:**
- Creating multiple textbooks with different collaborators
- Each textbook as an independent repository
- Working in Claude Code web interface (one textbook at a time)
- Managing separate access control per textbook

```

**Each textbook:**
- Independent GitHub repository
- Own collaborators and permissions
- Deploys to `yourname.github.io/textbook-name/`
- Stays updated with simple sync scripts

**See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for complete workflow documentation.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (recommended) or pip
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmccreary/intelligent-textbooks.git
   cd intelligent-textbooks
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   # Using conda (recommended)
   conda create -n mkdocs python=3
   conda activate mkdocs
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install mkdocs "mkdocs-material[imaging]"
   ```

3. **For social card generation (macOS)**
   ```bash
   brew install cairo freetype libffi libjpeg libpng zlib
   export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
   ```

### Development

```bash

## 🛠️ Creating MicroSims

MicroSims are self-contained interactive educational simulations. Each follows this structure:

```
docs/sims/your-sim-name/
├── index.md          # Documentation and embedding
├── main.html         # Standalone HTML page  
└── your-sim-name.js  # p5.js simulation code
```

**Template Usage:** Start with `docs/sims/templates/` for consistent structure and styling.
