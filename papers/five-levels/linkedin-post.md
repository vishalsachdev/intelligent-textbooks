# LinkedIn Post for Five-Level Framework Paper

## Post Text

I just published a new preprint on OSF: A Five-Level Classification Framework for Intelligent Textbooks: Lessons from Autonomous Vehicle Standards

The education technology field lacks a shared vocabulary for discussing how "intelligent" a textbook really is. Is it just a PDF? Does it adapt to learners? Can it teach autonomously?

I propose borrowing from the automotive industry's successful SAE levels (0-5) for autonomous vehicles to create a similar framework for intelligent textbooks:

Level 1 - Static content (traditional textbooks)
Level 2 - Interactive content with MicroSims (graph-centric, embedded simulations, path recommendations)
Level 3 - Adaptive content driven by student goals and progress (requires storage of student records)
Level 4 - AI tutoring with chatbots and LLMs (increase in costs per student)
Level 5 - Fully autonomous instruction with real-time content generation (AGI tutor)

**Key findings:**

1. METR research shows AI capabilities doubling every 7 months. By 2030, Level 2 content could cost pennies per student per day.

2. Level 3 is a **privacy inflection point**. Below it, minimal student data needed. Above it, systems require detailed learning histories—raising FERPA, COPPA, and GDPR concerns.

3. As Level 1-2 content becomes free, educational organizations must focus on Level 3+ capabilities to remain viable.

I'd love your feedback—especially from those building or using educational technology. What level are your current tools?
