## Search Engine Indexing

The EdArXiv preprint is hosted on the OSF Preprints platform, which is fully indexed by:

- Google Scholar
- Web of Science
- OpenAlex
- Europe PMC
- Standard search engines (Google, Bing, etc.)

### Timeline

- **General search engines**: Usually within days to a few weeks
- **Google Scholar**: Can take longer - no specific timeframe is guaranteed, and full index rebuilds happen twice a year

### Factors Affecting Google Scholar Indexing

For proper indexing, preprints should have:

1. **Complete author names** - Google Scholar doesn't support single-name authors (e.g., just "Dan" won't work; needs "Dan McCreary")
2. **Proper capitalization** - Names should be "Dan McCreary" not "dan mccreary" or "DAN MCCREARY"
3. **Publication DOI linking** - If there's an existing publication DOI linked to this preprint, it will be indexed as a new version during biannual rebuilds

### Verification

To check indexing status:

- Search Google Scholar directly for the paper title
- Set up a Google Scholar profile and link your work
- Check OSF metrics on the preprint page
